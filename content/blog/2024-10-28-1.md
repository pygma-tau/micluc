I think I much better understand why Deng viewed China as a particularly lawless country. You can just look at Chinese history from 1880-1950 and look at the amount of Chinese who died.

Dwarkesh seems to have the belief that Mao was more delusional than Stalin, because the deaths in the Great Leap Forward were counterproductive. 

Mao becomes "Emperor of China" in the Korean War. (This is when the myth of Mao starts to be stabilized)

there's a really interesting boomer / zoomer divide where Dwarkesh doesn't intrinsically realize that people actually die when they go to fight

what good has the UN done other than the WHO?

worried that situation with lydia is unrecoverable
