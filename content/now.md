Am studying mathematics & comparative literature at Berkeley. 

Lately, I've been quite into homotopy type theory, statistical optimal transport, and Octavio Paz.  

If you:
- are appalled at the decrepit state of content curation in the 21st century;
- know where to find a semi-permanent home for Berkeley Socratica;
- or have an inkling of how to run microtubule experiments somewhere in the Bay Area;

[Talk to me!](https://calendly.com/yudhister/) Thanks :D
