I really, really did not want to write this book review. Rand-as-aesthete is appalling because she cannot divorce her taste from her politics. She herself is the perfect embodiment of exactly that which she claims to despise.[^1] Not because rational esthetics are inherently self-contradictory, but because her approach to Art blinds herself to beauty.[^2]


[^1]: > Those who feel that art is outside the province of reason would be well advised to leave this book alone: it is not for them. Those who know that nothing is outside the province of reason will find in this book the base of a rational esthetics. It is the absence of such a base that has made todayâ€™s obscenely grotesque degradation of art possible.

[^2]: I myself am sympathetic to objectivist-flavored approaches to art criticism.
